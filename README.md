## My process

### Project Structure

- `/` Home Component
  - masonry gallery view of all available images for slideshow
- `/slide/:id` SlideDetail Component
  - select one image from gallery view to see slide details, but slideshow does not start
- `/slideshow` Slideshow Component
  - SlideDetail Component, starting with first slide
- `/slideshow/:id` || `/lightbox`Slideshow Component
  - SlideDetail Component, starting with slide `:id`

### Approach
### Built with


- <b>[Angular](https://angular.io/)</b> (<b>JavaScript</b> framework)
  - [<b>RxJs</b>(Reactive Extensions for JavaScript)](https://rxjs.dev/guide/overview) -  a library for composing async and event-based programs by using observable sequences(think of <b>RxJS</b> as <b>[Lodash](https://lodash.com/)</b> for events.) 
    - [Observables
]() 
  - [Routing]() 
  - [Dynamic Components](https://angular.io/guide/dynamic-component-loader) 
  - [Services](https://angular.io/guide/creating-injectable-service) 
   - [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/) 
      - [Image lists
](https://m2.material.io/components/image-lists#types) - display a collection of images in an organized grid. Image list was used to create the Masonry layout
      - [Progress bar](https://material.angular.io/components/progress-bar/overview) - a horizontal progress-bar for indicating progress and activity.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/)
- <b>[Figma](https://www.figma.com/)</b> collaborative web application for interface design.
- <b>[Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)/CSS</b> custom properties
  - Mobile-first workflow
  - Flexbox
  - CSS Grid
- Semantic <b>HTML5</b> markup
