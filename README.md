## My process
...
### Project Structure

- `/` Home Component
  - masonry gallery view of all available images for slideshow
- `/slide/:id` SlideDetail Component
  - select one image from gallery view to see slide details, but slideshow does not start
- `/slideshow` Slideshow Component
  - SlideDetail Component, starting with first slide
- `/slideshow/:id` Slideshow Component
  - SlideDetail Component, starting with slide `:id`

### Approach
### Built with


- <b>[Angular](https://angular.io/)</b> (<b>JavaScript</b> framework)
  - [<b>RxJs</b>(Reactive Extensions for JavaScript)](https://rxjs.dev/guide/overview) -  a library for composing async and event-based programs by using observable sequences(think of <b>RxJS</b> as <b>[Lodash](https://lodash.com/)</b> for events.) 
   - [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/)
  - [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
  - [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/)
- <b>[Figma](https://www.figma.com/)</b> collaborative web application for interface design.
- <b>[Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)/CSS</b> custom properties
  - Mobile-first workflow
  - Flexbox
  - CSS Grid
- Semantic HTML5 markup

<!-- Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below: -->

<!-- ```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
``` -->

<!-- ```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
``` -->

<!-- ```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("üéâ");
};
``` -->


## Continued development
### Features to Add
‚ûï <b> ‚è∏ button to pause slideshow</b>

‚ûï <b> Animations</b>
<!-- - [ ] Add Cool Animations -->

animation-duration: 150ms; -->

‚ûï <b> Option to view/add more artwork</b>
- [ ] allow user to view more artwork by incorprating an API like [Artsy](https://developers.artsy.net/) and categories/collections selection?
<!-- fake backend?

 -->
‚ûï <b> Infinite Scroll</b>
- [ ] after adding [Artsy (/genes)](https://developers.artsy.net/v2/docs/genes) API, add infinite scroll?  
(‚ú®[Implementing Infinite Scrolling Using Angular](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/implementing-infinite-scrolling-using-angular-82c66f27e817))

‚ûï <b> Update masonry layout</b>
