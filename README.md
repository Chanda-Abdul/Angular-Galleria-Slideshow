## My process
...
### Project Structure
...
### Approach
## Built with


- <b>[Angular](https://angular.io/)</b> (<b>JavaScript</b> framework)
  - [<b>RxJs</b>(Reactive Extensions for JavaScript)](https://rxjs.dev/guide/overview) -  a library for composing async and event-based programs by using observable sequences(think of <b>RxJS</b> as <b>[Lodash](https://lodash.com/)</b> for events.) 
   - [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/)
  - [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
  - [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/)
- <b>[Figma](https://www.figma.com/)</b> collaborative web application for interface design.
- <b>[Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)/CSS</b> custom properties
  - Mobile-first workflow
  - Flexbox
  - CSS Grid
- Semantic HTML5 markup

<!-- Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below: -->

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("üéâ");
};
```


## Continued development
- [ ] allow user to view more artwork by incorprating an API like [Artsy](https://developers.artsy.net/)?
- [ ] after adding API, add infinite scroll? categories/collections?  ([Implementing Infinite Scrolling Using Angular](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/implementing-infinite-scrolling-using-angular-82c66f27e817))
- [ ] change from vertical to horizontal masonry layout
- [ ] maybe combine this project with [Frontend Mentor - Modern Art Gallery Website Solution](https://github.com/Chanda-Abdul/Modern-Art-Gallery-Website). Create some kind of "view virtual gallery" option
